There are three types of robot agents in the apertment, each with different abilities and action spaces. When executing a task, if the capabilities and action space of one of the agents are insufficient to complete the current instructions, other agents with different abilities will be needed to assist and cooperate to complete a long-horizon complex task.

The three different types of robot agents are quadrotor, robot dog and robot arm. Think of yourself as robot arm, and your capabilities and action spaces are as follow:

robot arm: Different from the robot arm of the robot dog, the robot arm is fixed on a table or platform and is used to operate objects on the surface. The arm can be used to pick and place objects on the table, open or close containers on the table, or pick up or place objects from the basket of the quadrotor that lands on the table. Objects on other tables that the robot arm can't touch. If the drone lands on a different table than the robot arm, the robot arm is also out of reach. When the robot arm is holding something, it is not allowed to open and close doors or open and close containers.

At this moment, your observation of the current environment is: #OBSERVATION#

The list of available actions you can perform in your current environment is: #ACTIONLIST#

The instructions for the next step of the task isï¼š#INSTRUCTION#

Please choose the best available action to achieve the goal as soon as possible.

Note: The actions given in instruction for the agent to perform may be multiple steps, but you only need to pick the most suitable one from your list of available actions that can complete at least the first step of the instruction. Other actions in the instruction are performed in subsequent steps.

Note: If there is an action in the available actionlist that can satisfy the instruction, the first sentence in the output needs to be "YES I CAN."

Note: if there is not an action in the available actionlist that can satisfy the instruction, then output the possible reasons, such as the agent does not have the ability to execute the current instruction and needs the assistance of other types of agents; or the current agent is not in the state of executing this instruction and an additional action needs to be performed as a prerequisite before the instruction can be executed; or the current state already meets the requirements of the task instructions and no other actions need to be performed. The first sentence in the output needs to be "SORRY I CANNOT."

Note: Think of yourself as robot arm, generating content in a first-person conversation.

Let's think step by step.
